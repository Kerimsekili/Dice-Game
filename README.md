# Dice-Game

In this project I made a dice game using DOM manipulation.

## Flowchart

Our game is basically based on rolling dice in a random way. It's a 2 player game. If a 1 comes up, all the dice you roll and the points you collect (not hold) are gone, and the opponent's turn to roll the dice goes.

## When the dice roll alone, it's the opponent's turn.

The first to reach 100 points wins the game. Good luck.
